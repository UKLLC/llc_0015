Socio-demographic determinants of COVID-19 infection

Research has shown that some people are more at risk of COVID-19 than others because of personal factors, such as sex, ethnicity, or financial situation. In this study, we aim to understand whether differences in peoples’ personal factors increase their risk of COVID-19. To do this, we will link data from 10 research studies with data on COVID-19 infection status from NHS health records. We will use statistical modelling to look at the relationship between personal factors and COVID-19. We will also look at whether certain combinations of personal factors increase someone’s risk of COVID-19 further. For example, are Ethnic Minority women without a university degree more likely to report having had COVID-19 than others? . We will also test if our results differ depending on whether information about COVID infection is taken from research participants’ own reports, or from blood tests. 
Our findings will identify groups of individuals who had the highest risk of COVID-19 in the early waves of the pandemic. We will share the results with policy makers to help with decisions on how to support and protect these people.
